# infra-azure-provisioning

This repository contains the infrastructure as code implementation and pipelines necessary for the required infrastructure to host OSDU on Azure.

The `osdu` - R3 MVP Architecture solution template is intended to provision Managed Kubernetes resources like AKS and other core OSDU cloud managed services like Cosmos, Blob Storage and Keyvault.

## Cloud Resource Architecture

![Architecture](./docs/images/architecture.png "Architecture")


## Cost

Azure environment cost ballpark [estimate](https://tinyurl.com/y4e9s7rf). This is subject to change and is driven from the resource pricing tiers configured when the template is deployed.


## Prerequisites

1. Azure Subscription
1. Terraform and Go are locally installed.
1. Requires the use of [direnv](https://direnv.net/).
1. Install the required common tools (kubectl, helm, and terraform).


### Install the required tooling

This document assumes one is running a current version of Ubuntu. Windows users can install the Ubuntu Terminal from the Microsoft Store. The Ubuntu Terminal enables Linux command-line utilities, including bash, ssh, and git that will be useful for the following deployment. _Note: You will need the Windows Subsystem for Linux installed to use the Ubuntu Terminal on Windows_.


Currently the versions in use are [Terraform 0.14.4](https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.14.4/) and [GO 1.12.14](https://golang.org/dl/).

> Note: Terraform and Go are recommended to be installed using a [Terraform Version Manager](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv) and a [Go Version Manager](https://github.com/stefanmaric/g)


### Install the Azure CLI

For information specific to your operating system, see the [Azure CLI install guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest). You can also use the single command install if running on a Unix based machine.

```bash
curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash

# Login to Azure CLI and ensure subscription is set to desired subscription
az login
az account set --subscription <your_subscription>
```


### Configure and Work with an Azure Devops Project

> [Role Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/security/about-security-identity?view=azure-devops): Working on ADO Organizations require certain Roles for the user.  To perform these activities a user must be able to create an ADO project in an organization and have administrator level access to the Project created.

Configure an Azure Devops Project in your Organization called `osdu-mvp` and set the cli command to use the organization by default.

```bash
export ADO_ORGANIZATION=<organization_name>
export ADO_PROJECT=osdu-mvp

# Ensure the CLI extension is added
az extension add --name azure-devops

# Setup a Project Space in your organization
az devops project create --name $ADO_PROJECT --organization https://dev.azure.com/$ADO_ORGANIZATION/

# Configure the CLI Defaults to work with the organization and project
az devops configure --defaults organization=https://dev.azure.com/$ADO_ORGANIZATION project=$ADO_PROJECT
```

## Clone the repository

It is recommended to work with this repository in a WSL Ubuntu directory structure.

```bash
git clone git@community.opengroup.org:osdu/platform/deployment-and-operations/infra-azure-provisioning.git

cd infra-azure-provisioning
```


## Create a Flux Manifest Repository

[Create an empty git repository](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/create-new-repo?view=azure-devops) with a name that clearly signals that the repo is used for the Flux manifests. For example `k8-gitops-manifests`.

Flux requires that the git repository have at least one commit. Initialize the repo with an empty commit.

```bash
export ADO_REPO=k8-gitops-manifests

# Initialize a Git Repository
(mkdir k8-gitops-manifests \
  && cd k8-gitops-manifests \
  && git init \
  && git commit --allow-empty -m "Initializing the Flux Manifest Repository")

# Create an ADO Repo
az repos create --name $ADO_REPO
export GIT_REPO=git@ssh.dev.azure.com:v3/${ADO_ORGANIZATION}/${ADO_PROJECT}/k8-gitops-manifests

# Push the Git Repository
(cd k8-gitops-manifests \
  && git remote add origin $GIT_REPO \
  && git push -u origin --all)
```

In order for Automated Pipelines to be able to work with this repository the following Permissions must be set in the ADO Project for `All Repositories/Permissions` on the user `osdu-mvp Build Service`.

- Create Branch `Allow`
- Contribute `Allow`
- Contribute to Pull requests `Allow`



## Provision the Common Resources
> [Role Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/rbac-and-directory-admin-roles): Provisioning Common Resources requires owner access to the subscription, however AD Service Principals are created that will required an AD Admin to grant approval consent on the principals created.


The script `common_prepare.sh` script is a _helper_ script designed to help setup some of the common things that are necessary for infrastructure.

- Ensure you are logged into the azure cli with the desired subscription set.
- Ensure you have the access to run az ad commands.

```bash
# Execute Script
export UNIQUE=demo

./infra/scripts/common_prepare.sh $(az account show --query id -otsv) $UNIQUE
```

Integration Tests requires 2 Azure AD User Accounts, a tenant user and a guest user to be setup in order to use for integration testing.  This activity needs to be performed by someone who has access as an AD User Admin.

- ad-guest-email (ie: integration.test@email.com)
- ad-guest-oid (OID of the user)
- ad-user-email (ie: integration.test@{tenant}.onmicrosoft.com
- ad-user-oid (OID of the user)

```bash
USER_EMAIL=""
USER_EMAIL_OID=""
GUEST_EMAIL=""
GUEST_EMAIL_OID=""

az keyvault secret set --vault-name $COMMON_VAULT --name "ad-user-email" --value $USER_EMAIL
az keyvault secret set --vault-name $COMMON_VAULT --name "ad-user-oid" --value $USER_EMAIL_OID
az keyvault secret set --vault-name $COMMON_VAULT --name "ad-guest-email" --value $GUEST_EMAIL
az keyvault secret set --vault-name $COMMON_VAULT --name "ad-guest-oid" --value $GUEST_EMAIL_OID
```

Istio Configuration setups a Dashboard that requires some admin credentials.  Automation Pipelines uses settings out of the common keyvault for applying the values of the Istio Dashboard default credentials.

```bash
ISTIO_USERNAME=""
ISTIO_PASSWORD=""


az keyvault secret set --vault-name $COMMON_VAULT --name "istio-username" --value $(echo $ISTIO_USERNAME |base64)
az keyvault secret set --vault-name $COMMON_VAULT --name "istio-password" --value $(echo $ISTIO_PASSWORD |base64)
```

__Local Script Output Resources__

The script creates some local files to be used.

1. .envrc_{UNIQUE} -- This is a copy of the required environment variables for the common components.
2. .envrc -- This file is used directory by direnv and requires `direnv allow` to be run to access variables.
3. ~/.ssh/osdu_{UNIQUE}/azure-aks-gitops-ssh-key -- SSH key used by flux.
4. ~/.ssh/osdu_{UNIQUE}/azure-aks-gitops-key.pub -- SSH Public Key used by flux.
5. ~/.ssh/osdu_{UNIQUE}/azure-aks-node-ssh-key -- SSH Key used by AKS
6. ~/.ssh/osdu_{UNIQUE}/azure-aks-node-ssh-key.pub -- SSH Public Key used by AKS
7. ~/.ssh/osdu_{UNIQUE}/azure-aks-node-ssh-key.passphrase -- SSH Key Passphrase used by AKS

> Ensure environment variables are loaded `direnv allow`

__Installed Azure Resources__

1. Resource Group
2. Storage Account
3. Key Vault
4. A principal to be used by Terraform to create all resources for an OSDU Environment.
5. A principal required by an OSDU environment deployment.
6. An AD application to be leveraged that defines and controls access to the OSDU Environment for AD Identity.
7. An AD application to be used for negative integration testing

> Removal would require deletion of all AD elements `osdu-mvp-{UNIQUE}-*`, unlocking and deleting the resource group.

## Elastic Search Setup

Infrastructure requires a bring your own Elastic Search Instance of a version of 7.x (ie: 7.11.1) with a valid https endpoint and the access information must now be stored in the Common KeyVault. The recommended method of Elastic Search is to use the [Elastic Cloud Managed Service from the Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/elastic.ec-azure?tab=Overview).

> Note: Elastic Cloud Managed Service requires a Credit Card to be associated to the subscription for billing purposes.

```bash
ES_ENDPOINT=""
ES_USERNAME=""
ES_PASSWORD=""
az keyvault secret set --vault-name $COMMON_VAULT --name "elastic-endpoint-dp1-${UNIQUE}" --value $ES_ENDPOINT
az keyvault secret set --vault-name $COMMON_VAULT --name "elastic-username-dp1-${UNIQUE}" --value $ES_USERNAME
az keyvault secret set --vault-name $COMMON_VAULT --name "elastic-password-dp1-${UNIQUE}" --value $ES_PASSWORD


cat >> .envrc << EOF

# https://cloud.elastic.co
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
export TF_VAR_elasticsearch_endpoint="$ES_ENDPOINT"
export TF_VAR_elasticsearch_username="$ES_USERNAME"
export TF_VAR_elasticsearch_password="$ES_PASSWORD"

EOF

cp .envrc .envrc_${UNIQUE}
```

## Configure Key Access in Manifest Repository

The public key of the `azure-aks-gitops-ssh-key` previously created needs to be added as a deploy key in your Azure DevOPS Project, follow these [steps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/use-ssh-keys-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops&tabs=current-page#step-2--add-the-public-key-to-azure-devops-servicestfs) to add your public SSH key to your ADO environment.

```bash
# Retrieve the public key
az keyvault secret show \
  --id https://$COMMON_VAULT.vault.azure.net/secrets/azure-aks-gitops-ssh-key-pub \
  --query value \
  -otsv
```


## Install OSDU

There are 2 methods that can be chosen to perform installation at this point in time.

1. Manual Installation -- Typically used when the desire is to manually make modifications to the environment and have full control all updates and deployments.

__AKS Upgrade Steps__

AKS supports upgrade to only one major version i.e. 1.20 to 1.21
For checking the compatible upgrade use the following command:
```bash
az aks get-versions --location centralus --output table
```

__Data Migration for Entitlements from Milestone 4(v0.7.0) or lower, to Milestone 5(v0.8.0) or higher__

Milestone 5(v0.8.0) introduced a breaking changed for Entitlements, which required migration of data using the scipt
[here](https://community.opengroup.org/osdu/platform/security-and-compliance/entitlements/-/tree/master/data-migration).
The script should be run whenever you update OSDU installation from less than Milestone 5(v0.8.0) to equivalent or higher.
