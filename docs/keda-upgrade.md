## Upgade keda version from 1.5 to 2.x

### [Outdated] Infra deployment steps 
Note: Infrastructure has already permanently enabled keda v2 and we dropped support of this feature flag.
> We've used feature flag to upgrade keda version from 1.5 to 2.x osdu infra on azure.
> A user can follow following steps to upgrade keda version - 
> 
> 1. We've set keda_v2_enabled field in feature_flag variable in service resource to false.
> It represents that currently osdu infra is currently using 1.5 version.
> 2. If using flux, reduce replica count to 0 for flux deployment until step 4. (use command - kubectl edit deployment flux -n flux)
> 3. Either run it or follow the steps in this script - infra/scripts/keda_upgrade_and_host_encryption.sh. 
>    This script requires some inputs. Feel free to edit the script as per requirement.
> 4. Override keda_v2_enabled field to true.
